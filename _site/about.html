        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>Nestled among majestic live oaks and oozing with the flavor and soul of the Nola Garden District, Cafe Luna has been a coffee and community haven for locals and visitors for a quarter of a century. Around here, we know that anything tastes better when you make it from scratch, coffee tastes better when you drink it on a big ole porch, and any afternoon outing is better when you can bring your dog along. We also know that the loveliest, laziest Sunday mornings must include brunch, and that a room without books is like a body without a soul (we may have borrowed that last one). Mosey our way, make yourself at home, and stay a while -- we look forward to sharing our knowledge of pastries, porches, and pour overs with you.</p>
